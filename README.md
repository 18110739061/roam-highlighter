# roam-highlighter

Follow instructions in the Video ([Linking it Here](https://www.screencast.com/t/7vYK9qMGqIyY)) under the Getting Started section below to install Chrome Extension on your machine with my roam-highlighter code. Very easy to do! **Video is under 8 minutes** and will have you up and running! Looking for any and all feedback from folks!

## How to Use the Highlighter

- Install Chrome Extension on local machines via instructional Video below
- Press the Highlighter icon in Chrome Extensions toolbar to activate it (only applies to the Tab you click it on)
- Select text in an article you want to highlight and press `Ctrl + X` ("cut" command on Windows) to highlight.
- If you just want a quick way to grab a Link to the page in the [Page title](URL) format for Roam without having to highlight anything, simply use `Ctrl + X` without any text selected or Highlights and it will just copy that to the clipboard for you.
- `Click` a highlight if you want to remove it later.
- Everything auto updates and copies to clipboard anytime you make any changes.
- Paste into Roam and the formatting will do the work for you.
- If you don't like the way it handles Line Breaks by default, there are 4 options to quickly switch between.
- Simple go back to your webpage and press `Ctrl + V` ("paste" command on windows) to bring up an options input.
- Four Options for handling line breaks within each selected highlight by the user (see Demo #3 below)
  1. `Set to 0` (Default) if you want line breaks (e.g., each paragraph) to create new bullets at same hierarchy/level
  2. `Set to 1` if you want line breaks (e.g., each paragraph) to create new bullets, but nested underneath the first "paragraph" in the highlight
  3. `Set to 2` if you want line breaks (e.g., each paragraph) to be in same bullet with `Ctrl + Enter` "soft line breaks" like `Ctrl + Shift + V` does in browser pasting
  4. `Set to 3` if you want line breaks (e.g., each paragraph) to be replaced with a "space" and simply concatenated into a single bullet and without any line breaks
