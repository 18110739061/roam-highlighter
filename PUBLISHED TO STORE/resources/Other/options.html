<div><span>4 Options for handling line breaks within each selected highlight by the user (a few words, or a few paragraphs... whatever user selects as a single highlight)</span></div>
<ul>
    <li>Set to 1 (Default) if you want line breaks (e.g., each paragraph) to create new bullets at same hierarchy/level</li>
    <li>Set to 2 if you want line breaks (e.g., each paragraph) to create new bullets, but nested underneath the first "paragraph" in the highlight</li>
    <li>Set to 3 if you want line breaks (e.g., each paragraph) to be in same bullet with Ctrl + Shift "soft line breaks" like Ctrl+Shift+V does in browser pasting</li>
    <li>Set to 4 if you want line breaks (e.g., each paragraph) to be replaced with a "space" and simply concatenated into a single bullet and without any line breaks</li>
</ul>
